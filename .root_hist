    Add run numbers of all the latest available in Basel to the file May_16.dat TICK
    Check the logbook and comment out all the runs not needed and add a reason why. TICK
    Understand Thomas' Email and if not email Homie Domi. TICK
    Run AddMoreRuns.C and make sure the numbers are correct in the files TICK
    Run ARSubmit this will do both the new ones and the good ones I deleted (if the .dat file is correctly updated) TICK
    To use the following macros need to do, root -b; .include $CALIB/include; .x macros/runsets/TAPSPED.C++
    Run TAPSPED  macro using long gate TICK
    Check in /tmp/ped.root which is the file it creates for all the pedestal fits SAVE SOME PLOTS.
    Run TAPSPED macro using short gate TICK
    Run the macro in same folder as TAPSPED for TAPSenergy long gate CANT GET THIS ONE TO WORK Changed a lot but made backup. Works but doesn't seem right and produces a root file in current directory. DONeish
    Run the macro in same folder as TAPSPED for TAPStime  Doneish
    Run the macro in same folder as TAPSPED for CBEnergy NOT WORKING Doneish
    Run the macro in same folder as TAPSPED for CBtime Doneish
    Check the calibrate GUI for each of these.  add to database!!!!
    Delete the root files in /usr/panther_scratch0/mullen/AR/May_16/
    Run AddMoreRuns.C and make sure the numbers are correct in the files
    Run ARSubmit update the .dat file
     Then Repeat steps 6 onwards. However if pedestal positions are very similar after one iteration do not do them again.
14.1. Doing CalibGUI for TAPSPEDLG. Done saved plot
14.2 Doing CalibGui for TAPSPEDSG  Done saved plot
14.3 Doing CalibGui for TAPSEnergy Doneish Saved Plot but SG IS NOT DONE.  Not sure what I am doing Don't have a histogram for the short gate one as didnt do the run so need to do it again for that one.
14.4 Doing CalibGui for TAPSTime. Should I be ignoring the Lead Tungstate ones? as they are at 70ish. No after one run through they should move to position of the others. DONE
14.5 Doing CalibGui for CBEnergy. DONE
14.6 Doing CalibGui for CBTime. 
Actual run files are kept in the location /kernph/caracal_scratch0/data/A2/D-Butanol/May_16/
Histograms I produce are kept in /usr/panther_scratch0/mullen/AR/May_16/
Run ARSubmit to get histograms for the good runs I deleted. Need to watch the numbers in the files. Should I run add more runs then?
What does add more runs produce?
What does ARsubmit produce?
ARSubmit produces the histograms in /usr/panther_scratch0/mullen/AR/May_16/
These are the ones I deleted some good runs of.
