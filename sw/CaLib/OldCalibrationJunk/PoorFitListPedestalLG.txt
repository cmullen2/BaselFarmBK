ADC20018 run 13562 ->  no data presented but this one says it has 5 entries and has a fit
ADC20018 run 13564 ->  Shit fit

ADC20018 run 13580 ->   Fit not even on graph
ADC20018 run 13588 ->   Fit far down the second peak so crap.

There are too many to through them all. From now on I will just select the recurring runs across ADCs that are bad fits, no data etc.

The following two are present across almost all ADCs
The first one is run 13558
13559 both no data whatsoever


The following three are present across almost all ADCs
13645 not present 
13646 not present
13647 no data

13502: slight bump up in few, bad fit no pedestal peak visible.

13416: bad fit 

The following two are present across almost all ADCs
13561: only approx 20 data points(weird fit as result)
13562: No fit present too low data



13466 appeared in a few after overview 158; just bad fits


In the later overview fits there appears to be an approximately 6 channel drift down towards 95


ADC 231_23018 shows erratic behaviour; bad fits.
Similar poor fits are shown for the next ten ADCs
ADC 304_24018 shows erratic behaviour also.




NOTE: ADC 067_20462 has a drop of 30 channels average (Ask Dom)
ADC 085_21018 has erratic behaviour with 20 channel spread (Ask Dom) VERY bad fits across all.
ADC 087_21038 has a drop of 80 channels average. Almost none of them have fits.


The 29 ones are diff crystal types.
ADC 146_29048 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 147_29054 has drop of 50 channels average. Extremelyerratic
ADC 148_29050 has drop of 80 channels average.
ADC 149_29052 has drop of 10 channels average.
ADC 150_29056 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 151_29062 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 152_29058 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 153_29060 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 154_29060 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 155_29060 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 156_29060 has drop of 40 channels average.
ADC 157_29060 has drop of 40 channels average.
